# Introduction to terminal text editors

![https://xkcd.com/378/](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png)

If you're working on a remote cluster, odds are you'll need to edit text files at some point, even if only for a little bit. Since many connections to these remote computers don't support separate GUI's from opening, you may be tempted to download files, edit them, and then reupload. While simple, this process can be rather tedious and time consuming. Instead, you can save yourself some time by making use of one of the terminal text editors supported on most Unix systems.

If you're a beginner you'll probably want to try [Nano](./nano.html) as it has the easiest learning curve. However, [Vim](./emacs.html) and [Emacs](./emacs.html) are much more powerful editors for users with the time to learn how to use them.
