## High-Performance Computing Training Materials
##### [UW-Milwaukee Research Computing](https://uwm.edu/hpc/)

### Foreword

This workshop series will introduce you to basic concepts in High-Performance Computing.  If you need to use a cluster, this is a great way to get up to speed on how things work and why.

Any Unix-based machine has everything we need for the workshop. If you plan to use your personal laptop that runs Windows, you should install a terminal emulator, such as [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

We plan to offer interactive seminars once per semester to go over all the materials laid out here. The materials are also designed so that you can work through them at your own pace if you prefer to work at your own pace.

#### Threaded Parallel Computing for Engineers

This lesson on OpenMP (and the next on MPI) are available in an ipython notebook.
A static view of the notebook is also available:

If you are running on your own computer and *already have OpenMP and the jupyter notebook installed*, simply navigating to your desired folder and using the last two lines is sufficient.  If you are on Windows, note that the wget command will not work, but you should be able to type the link into a browser and copy all of the text into a file named `omp-c.ipynb`.

##### OpenMP on OS X
If you are using a personal laptop computer running OS X operating system, you have to install GNU GCC without multilib support. The reason behind this is that clang — the default compiler on a Mac computer — does not support OpenMP. Moreover, gcc is just a symbolic link to clang. The easiest way to install GNU GCC is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor  ; # fix as many errors/warnings as possible
brew install gcc --without-multilib
```

#### Distributed Parallel Computing for Engineers

The [Message-Passing Interface](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/) is the *de facto* standard for all large-scale distributed-memory cluster computing. We will examine the basics of this standard in C (and can touch on C++ and Fortran), as well as discuss some numerical coding applications and considerations. Programming experience with C or C++ is assumed.

If you prefer to use openmpi instead of mpich2, you can can change that in the first line.  A static view of the notebook is also available:

##### MPI on OS X:
If you are using a personal laptop computer running OS X operating system, you have to install an mpi compiler. The easiest way to get it on a Mac is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew doctor  ; # fix as many errors/warnings as possible
brew install gcc --without-multilib
```
